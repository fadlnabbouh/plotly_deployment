# Plotly_Deployment

The purpose of this repository was to create a dashboard of particpants' navel biodiversity profile. Improbable Bacteria is a food start-up that is attempting to identify species of bacteria that can synthesize beef-tasting protein. They have partnered with a lab that hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species for synthesizing the optimal beef-tasing protein is found in the human navel. The lab has sampled the bacteria within the belly buttons of anonymous participants.

Using Plotly, Javascript, and D3, this interactive dashboard was generated to allow participants and lab members an easy way to filter and visualize the collected data. The dashboard can be found here: [Dashboard](https://fadlnabbouh.github.io/plotly_deployment/).
